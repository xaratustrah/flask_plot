# flask_plot

Webapp excercise on using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), based on the [Flask4Scientists](https://github.com/hplgit/web4sciapps) tutorial by [@hplgit](https://github.com/hplgit). Also using [Flask_Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I have changed some lines to adapt the code to python3 syntax.
